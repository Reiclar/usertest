                        <p>If a wild pigeon appears healthy, do not bother them. If you intend to feed them, though bread is the most popular choice, it is not as nutritious for birds. Feed dried corn, peas, and seeds. 

                            Suppose a wild pigeon is hurt or sick. In that case, you can identify this by lethargy, irregular flapping of wings but no flight, visible signs of injury such as a broken leg or blood, or the extended head retraction into the body as the bird is sitting. 
                            
                            Safety:
                            First and foremost, you should prioritize the stress levels of the bird. Ensure that they are handled with the utmost care, and when moved, must not be around noise, bright lights, or predatory animals. Do not treat the wild bird as a domestic pet and touch them excessively, as it may increase stress. 
                            
                            Your options:
                            The point of care at this point can take two routes: professional care and personal care.
                            
                            It is best to surrender the bird to wildlife authorities, such as an avian veterinarian, an exotic veterinarian, or a wildlife rehabilitation center. If the bird has any visible physical injuries, especially blood, or if they present neurological issues (wobbliness), they especially fall into this category. 
                            
                            If you are considering personal care, proceed to the following points:
                            
                            After you transfer the pigeon into a cage/shoebox, away from noise, any danger, and in a dimly lit room, ensure further comfort by placing a warm towel with them. Warmth is especially important if you rescue a baby pigeon, which can be identified by their baldness, small size, and thick, spiky downy feathers that will eventually be replaced by adult feathers. In such a situation, they need a parent to warm them up, thus, the extra towels and a heating pad set on low beneath them or under the cage itself will be beneficial.
                            
                            Before feeding, ensure that the pigeon can drink water. Baby pigeons require crop milk from their parents. Crop milk replacement can be bought online, though some avian veterinarians may carry it. If you are looking for a more affordable option, this can be made using ground oats, a quarter of a boiled egg, and water. Grind or blend the dry materials into a paste before adding water and mixing. The final result should have a soup-like consistency. Feed this mixture using a feeding/oral syringe.
                            
                            Once the bird has eaten, attempt to feed it some seeds. Pre-mixes can be bought that include a healthy variety such as corn, peas, red milo, safflower, millet, and hard red wheat. Minced vegetables are recommended as well. Ensure continued access to clean, warm water after. If the pigeon is not eating, this requires immediate professional attention, as pigeons have a high metabolism and eat very often. 
                            
                            For baby pigeons, look out for crop stasis, an occurrence when the food sits at the top for too long if the food is too thick or cold or if the bird itself is too cold when fed. This can lead the bird to become sick and pass away. To avoid this, check the crop (the area from the lower chest to the underbelly) to determine if it is emptying. You will be able to feel the food or its weight with your fingers. 
                            
                            Make sure to ask veterinarians or a wildlife center if problems arise, or a community such as pigeon/bird owner forums. After the pigeon regains its health, as your local wildlife center if a release is recommended. If so, take the pigeon to an open, empty, outdoor space and allow it to take its time to fly off. 
                            
                            If the pigeon appears to have become attached to you and especially reliant, congratulations! You have a new companion
