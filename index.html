    <p class="par-group-2"> Humans have kept and selectively bred pigeons for thousands of years, leading to their domestication. 
        We have used them for communication, sports, or simply just as companions, so they prefer to live among us.
        Throughout the centuries they've never forgotten their loyalty to us, but it seems that we've forgotten ours. 
    
    <p class="par-group-3"> This site aims to help you grow to appreciate these "skye rats" for the loving birds they are, and give them the affection that they deserve.
